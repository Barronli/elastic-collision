## Compute the times of elastic collisions between two objects and a wall

Object A stays between a wall and object B. Object B moves with velocity Vb to collide with object A. Count the times of collision between object A and B, and between object A and the wall.

The mass of B is 100^n times of A's mass. Then the bounce times become Pi x 10^n.
